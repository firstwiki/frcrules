A ROBOT may not cause a BOULDER to move from the NEUTRAL ZONE into the opponent’s COURTYARD unless:

A. the ROBOT contacts the BOULDER within OUTER WORKS, and

B. the ROBOT completes its CROSSING (e.g. doesn’t completely back out of the OUTER WORKS into the NEUTRAL ZONE)

_Violation: TECH FOUL per BOULDER_

>Examples meeting the requirements of this rule include, but are not limited to:
>
>A. A ROBOT picks up a BOULDER in the NEUTRAL ZONE, and CROSSES a DEFENSE carrying the BOULDER
>
>B. A ROBOT, starting in the NEUTRAL ZONE, bumps a BOULDER through a DEFENSE, contacting the BOULDER within the OUTER WORKS at least once. The ROBOT then completes the CROSSING itself.
>
>Examples NOT meeting this rule include, but are not limited to:
>
> A. A ROBOT fully in the NEUTRAL ZONE lobs a boulder over a DEFENSE, then CROSSES a DEFENSE (this violates the rule because the ROBOT did not contact the BOULDER within OUTER WORKS)
>
> B. A ROBOT fully in the NEUTRAL ZONE rolls a BOULDER over a DEFENSE, then CROSSES a DEFENSE (this violates the rule because the ROBOT did not contact the BOULDER within OUTER WORKS)
>
> C. A ROBOT attempts to CROSS a DEFENSE with a BOULDER, drops the BOULDER so it rolls into the opponent’s COURTYARD, backs fully out of the OUTER WORKS to get a running start, then CROSSES a DEFENSE (this violates the rule because the ROBOT completely backed out of OUTER WORKS into the NEUTRAL ZONE)
