ROBOTS may not pin an opponentâ€™s ROBOT for more than five (5) seconds. A ROBOT will be considered pinned until the ROBOTS have separated by at least six (6) feet. The pinning ROBOT(s) must then wait for at least three (3) seconds before attempting to pin the same ROBOT again. Pinning is transitory through other objects. If the pinned ROBOT chases the pinning ROBOT upon retreat, the pinning ROBOT will not be penalized, and the pin will be considered complete.

_Violation: FOUL. For every five (5) seconds in which the situation is not corrected, FOUL. If extended and egregious, RED CARD_
