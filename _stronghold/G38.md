ROBOTS may not control more than one (1) BOULDER at any time.

_Violation: FOUL per extra BOULDER_

>Moving or positioning a BOULDER to gain advantage is considered “control.”
>
>Examples include, but are not limited to:
>
>A. “carrying” (holding BOULDERS inside a ROBOT)
>
>B. “herding” (intentionally pushing or impelling BOULDERS to a desired location or direction)
>
>C. “trapping” (holding one or more BOULDERS against a FIELD element in an attempt to shield or guard them)
>
>D. “launching” (shooting BOULDERS into the air, kicking across the floor, or throwing in a forceful way)
>
>Examples of interaction with BOULDERS that are not “control” include, but are not limited to:
>
>A. “bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with BOULDERS while in the path of the ROBOT moving about the FIELD)
>
>B. “deflecting” (being hit by a BOULDER that bounces into or off of a ROBOT).
>
>If a BOULDER becomes lodged in or on a ROBOT, it will be considered controlled by the ROBOT. It is important to design your ROBOT so that it is impossible to inadvertently or unintentionally control more than the allowed maximum.
