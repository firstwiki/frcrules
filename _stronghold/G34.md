No more than six (6) BOULDERS may remain in a CASTLE during TELEOP. If the BOULDER count ever exceeds six (6), excess BOULDERS must be introduced to the FIELD immediately.

_Violation: FOUL per excess BOULDER_

> The intent is that as soon as a 7th BOULDER arrives in the CASTLE, the ALLIANCE begins a concerted, good will effort to enter any extra BOULDERS back on to the FIELD as quickly and as safely as possible. It is not our intent to issue penalties if the DRIVE TEAM member clearing any surplus BOULDERS gets hung up by having to work their way around other people in the CASTLE. However if they are perceived as deliberately lagging in the eyes of a REFEREE, they will be issued a penalty.
