A ROBOT may not use the SHIELD(S) to circumvent a DEFENSE.

_Violation: FOUL and YELLOW CARD_

> The DEFENSE SHIELDS are not intended to be weight bearing and are not to be used as a strategy for avoiding the challenge of the DEFENSE.
>
> For example, a ROBOT that “bounces” off of a DEFENSE SHIELD while traversing the DEFENSE is not in violation of this rule as their strategy was not to use the SHIELDS to avoid the DEFENSE. In contrast, a ROBOT “leapfrogging” or “spider climbing” across a DEFENSE by applying force to the SHIELDS and lifting itself over the DEFENSE is a violation of this rule.
