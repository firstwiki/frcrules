ROBOTS will not be re-enabled after the conclusion of the MATCH, nor will Teams be permitted to tether to the ROBOT except in special circumstances (e.g. during TIMEOUTS, after Opening Ceremonies, etc.) and with the express permission from the FTA or a REFEREE.

_Violation: YELLOW CARD_

> Tethering includes any wired or wireless connection used to electrically energize and/or control elements on the ROBOT. The safety of Teams and FIELD STEWARDS in close proximity to ROBOTS and ARENA elements on the FIELD is of the utmost importance, therefore ROBOTS or ROBOT COMPONENTS may not be energized or powered in any way on the FIELD once the match has concluded.
