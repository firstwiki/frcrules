ROBOT height, as measured when it’s resting normally on a flat floor, may not exceed 4 ft. 6 in. during the MATCH, except during the final twenty (20) seconds of TELEOP where there is no height limit when a ROBOT is fully contained by the opponent’s COURTYARD.

_Violation: FOUL. If strategic, offending ROBOT will be DISABLED._

>This measurement is intended to be made as if the ROBOT is resting on a flat floor, not relative to the height of the ROBOT from the FIELD carpet.
>
>For example, a ROBOT that is at an angle while traversing a DEFENSE may actually exceed the height limit when compared to the carpet of the FIELD.
>
>Teams should be mindful of safety if designing their ROBOTS to extend beyond the height of the CASTLE WALL.
