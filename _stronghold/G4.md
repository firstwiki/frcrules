DRIVE TEAMS may not extend any body part into the FIELD during the MATCH. Momentary encroachment through the hole in the HUMAN PLAYER STATION behind the BRATTICE while placing a BOULDER into that hole is an exception to this rule.

_Violation: FOUL. Violations of this rule are likely to escalate to YELLOW or RED CARDS rapidly (i.e. the threshold for egregious or repeated violations is relatively low)_

> Examples of egregious violations include, but are not limited to, walking onto the FIELD during a MATCH or intentionally reaching into the FIELD and grabbing a ROBOT during a MATCH.
