When placed on the FIELD for a MATCH, each ROBOT must be:

A. in compliance with all ROBOT rules, i.e. has passed Inspection (for exceptions regarding
Practice MATCHES, see Section 5 (5.5.2 Eligibility and Inspection)),

B. not in contact with a BOULDER staged on the MIDLINE,

C. the only item left on the FIELD by the DRIVE TEAM,

D. confined to its STARTING CONFIGURATION,

E. fully contained by the opposite half of the FIELD from their TOWER, and

  + i. breaking the plane of the AUTO LINE, or

  + ii. inside the COURTYARD, in contact with both the CASTLE WALL and GUARDRAIL. Only one (1) ROBOT per ALLIANCE, known as the “spy bot,” is allowed to start each MATCH in this position.

_Violation: If fix is a quick remedy, the MATCH won’t start until all requirements are met. If it is not a quick remedy the offending ROBOT will be DISABLED and, at the discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re-inspected._

> If a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM may not remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head REFEREE or the FIRST Technical Advisor (FTA).
