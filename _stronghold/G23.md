Fallen (i.e. tipped over) ROBOTS attempting to right themselves (either by themselves or with assistance from a partner ROBOT) have one ten (10) second grace period in which they may not be contacted by an opponent ROBOT. This protection lasts for either ten (10) seconds or until the protected ROBOT has completed the righting operation, whichever comes first.

_Violation: FOUL. If intentional, YELLOW CARD_
